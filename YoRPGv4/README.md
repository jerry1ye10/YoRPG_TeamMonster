# This is our most recent version of our YoRPG! 

We are creating an RPG in java. To run, go into your terminal and enter javac YoRPG.java. Then enter java YoRPG.This version of YoRPG uses Protagonist, Character, and Monster as abstract superclasses. 

## Classes

The superclass is Character. The Character extends to two different subclasses: Protagonist and Monster.

### Monster

This is the basic monster class with default attributes, extending from Character.

#### Damage Monster

This is an instance of a Monster that has enhanced attack damage algorithms which amplifies its damage output.

#### Health Monster

This is an instance of a Monster who is extraordinarily large and has more HP than a normal Monster. 

#### Devil Monster

This is an instance of a Monster, the worst nightmare for a Protagonist, a Monster with all attributes enhanced to unimaginable amounts. Very difficult to defeat.

### Protagonist

This is the basic Protagonist class with default attributes, extending from Character.

#### Damage Protagonist

This is an instance of a Protagonist with enhanced attack damage algorithms which amplifies its damage output. 

#### Tank Protagonist

This is an instance of a Protagonist who is extraordinarily large and has more HP than a normal Protagonist.

#### Super Protagonist

This is an instance of a Protagonist who is nearly impossible to be killed by a Monster, with unimaginably high attributes. Very difficult to lose with.
